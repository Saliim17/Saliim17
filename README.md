We always learn from the one we have next to us and in this case I remember a special person:
As [DD Creamo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0eDvMgVFoNV3TpwtrVCoTj?si=36Km5UQBSlK5VMdC9ewYow&dl_branch=1) once said in [his song](https://open.spotify.com/track/4Zdwjx7WiaB0YUNraGEfTR?si=399069d447664220)

> Be in control of your own s??t, of your own creations
Know what I'm sayin'? Like be a creator 
Like, I feel, like, when you create your s??t
When you know whatchu want, know what I mean? 
Don't let nobody get in between you and your creation
If you want somethin', it gotta be that 
Make it 'cause you know it
Nobodies gonna tell you, know what I'm sayin'? 
I wasn't thinkin' about the masses yet, I'm thinkin' 'bout my hood 
You know what I'm sayin'? I'm like, "Nah, I got to drop another one for the hood"
As long as you ain't on no s?ck?r s??t, you'll be aight 
You good, real ni??as gonna vibe with real ni??as
Know what I'm sayin'? You ain't W💫💫, you ain't winnin' in this s??t

Great words from DD Creamo, R.I.P. 💙💫
